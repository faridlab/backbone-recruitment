//! Outbound activity-scheduling port (hand-authored, user-owned).
//!
//! Recruitment wants to put a mail activity on an interviewer's plate when an
//! interview is scheduled (and, in the wider family, on task owners' plates
//! elsewhere) — but the activity table lives in the mail module's schema, and a
//! domain module must not grow a Cargo edge into another domain module. So the
//! dependency points the other way: this module declares the PORT, the host
//! app supplies the ADAPTER (an `ActivitySink` implemented over the mail
//! module's activity write service) at composition time.
//!
//! The default is [`UnwiredActivitySink`]: verbs that only *record* an
//! interview still work, and a verb that explicitly asks for a notification
//! fails closed with the stable `activity_seam_unwired` code rather than
//! silently skipping the notification — the caller asked for a side effect,
//! so "nothing happened" must be loud, not quiet.
